<p><?php echo $appname; ?> does not download actual TV episodes, it only downloads .torrent/.nzb files. In order to automate your downloads you need to also configure <?php echo $appname; ?> to communicate with a download program, like SABnzbd or NZBGet. A good guide to configure this integration between <?php echo $appname; ?> and SABnzbd, for example, can be found <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/72267/how-to-turn-your-computer-into-a-supercharged-tivo-with-sick-beard/" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to password-protect <?php echo $appname; ?> if it is going to be exposed to the internet. This can be done in the &quot;General&quot; settings page.</p>
